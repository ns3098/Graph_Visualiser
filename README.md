# Graph Visualiser

Program and library for building mathematical graphs and visualizing algorithms wrote with C++ and Qt.

To find Graph Library see [wiki](https://github.com/ns3098/Graph_Visualiser/wiki/Graph-Library).

## Features

### Main features
* Build graphs (oriented or not oriented)
* Save them to file
* Load plugins with graph algorithms and run with step-by-step animation
* Write your own algorithm and load it as plugin

**Note: To write your own algorithm plugin see [wiki](https://github.com/ns3098/Graph_Visualiser/wiki/Custom-algorithm-plugin).**

### Algorithms
* Breadth-first search (BFS)
* Depth-first search (DFS)
* Minimum spanning tree (Prim)
* Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal)
* Dijkstra
* Bridges

### Editing

* Clear

Vertex edit:

* Add, move and remove
* Change color
* Change radius
* Set label text

Merge edit:

* Add and remove
* Change color
